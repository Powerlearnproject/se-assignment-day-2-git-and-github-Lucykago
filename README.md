## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
(a)The version control system keeps detailed record of every modification made to the code,ensuring that this changes are both trackable and reversable.
(b)Git is the most popular version control as it has adaptability,speed and stability required to thrive in fast-paced markets.
(c)The version control systems maintain project intergrity by maintaining a comprehensive revision history,allowing them to track modification,revert to previous versions,and understand 
    the evolution of the codebase overtime.
## Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps involved, and what are some of the important decisions you need to make during this process?
(a) open your github account.
(b) In the upper- right corner of the page,select +,then click new repository.

## Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each, particularly in the context of collaborative projects?
(a) Public repositories are easy to set up more thsn private repositories as they require alittle more set up.
